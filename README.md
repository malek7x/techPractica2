## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### 1. Always Keep Your Branch Updated

Before starting development or building the project, make sure your branch is up to date:

```bash
# Fetch the latest updates from remote without changing your files
git fetch origin

# Switch to the master branch
git switch master

# Pull the latest changes from the remote master
git pull origin master

# Switch back to your feature branch
git switch your-branch-name

# Merge the updated master into your branch
git merge master

# Resolve conflicts if any, then commit
```

### 2. Running with Docker

The project uses Docker for easy environment setup.

To start the services, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start all necessary containers in detached mode.
